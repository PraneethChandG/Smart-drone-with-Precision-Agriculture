- **Sensor Integration** (temperature, humidity, soil moisture).
- **Real-time Data Monitoring** with wireless transmission.
- **Pest and Weed Detection** using image processing.
- **Automated Spraying System** for targeted application.
- **Data Logging** and analytics for agricultural insights.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Hardware**:
  - Arduino Uno / ESP32 Microcontroller
  - DHT11, Soil Moisture Sensors
  - Ultrasonic Sensor
  - Camera Module (for image capture)
  - GPS Module
  - Relay Module & Spraying Pump

- **Software**:
  - Arduino IDE
  - Embedded C/C++
  - Python (for image processing, if applicable)

The drone gathers real-time environmental and image data, processes it on-board or transmits it wirelessly, and performs actions accordingly (e.g., spraying pesticide only where pests are detected).

## 📸 Image Processing (Optional Module)

- Captures aerial images.
- Uses basic ML/image processing techniques to detect pest infestations.
- Triggers localized spraying based on detection results.

## 📈 Benefits

- Enhances crop yield through precision monitoring.
- Reduces pesticide usage.
- Enables data-driven farming decisions.
- Increases safety by reducing manual labor in hazardous areas.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo.
2. Upload code to Arduino/ESP32.
3. Connect the drone hardware components.
4. Launch the IoT dashboard to monitor and control.
